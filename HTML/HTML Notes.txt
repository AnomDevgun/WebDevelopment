## HTML Notes ##

HTML stands for hypertext markup language
Is a language or syntax used to markup a webpage (an early example was academic texts)
Broken down into HTML elements in the form of tags (opening and closing, enclosing the data)


# Head tags 
- H1 to H6 with H1 being the main head tags and all subsequent subheaders can be labelled as the others, H1 should be the main and only one.

# Self Closing tags - example: <br>, <hr>(horizontal rule tag)

#Comments created like- <!-- ABCD -->

Use em tag instead of i tag
Use strong tag instead of b tag
